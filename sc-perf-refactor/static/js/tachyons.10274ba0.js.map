</p>\n              <p className=\"fl w-100 w-50-l mh0 mt0 pr0 pr3-l measure lh-copy f5 f4-l\">\n                Design Systems break as they scale (either scaling org or\n                scaling product) because new components/variants of a component\n                are introduced. Those variants sometimes (read: often) go\n                undocumented, leading to duplication when that\n                component/variant is needed (and created) again. Even when the\n                component is documented, documenting effectively often means\n                dozens/hundreds of instances to capture all states/variants.\n                Systems like Tachyons et al. approach this problem by instead\n                documenting and limiting *properties* of components. (I like\n                to think of this as “subatomic” design.)\n              </p>\n              <p className=\"fl w-100 w-50-l mh0 mt0 pl0 pl3-l measure lh-copy f5 f4-l\">\n                You then create\n                components by composing subatomic components (properties).\n                Rather than creating a component and its variants, you simply\n                have a comprehensive list of “ingredient” subatomic components.\n                Those subatomic components can be combined in thousands of ways\n                to create hundreds of components. The properties of those\n                components are numerous, but constrained to a set of acceptable\n                values (our subatomic components).”\n              </p>\n              <cite className=\"fl w-100 mt2 f5 f4-m f3-l fs-normal\">\n                <span className=\"fw6\">Daniel Eden</span>\n                <span className=\"db f5\">Designer at Facebook</span>\n              </cite>\n            </blockquote>\n            <blockquote className=\"fl w-100 ph0 border-box mh0 mb4 mb5-ns pb5 bb b--black-50\">\n              <p className=\"f3 f1-ns measure fw7 lh-title mt0\">\n                Tachyons has seriously blown my mind.
